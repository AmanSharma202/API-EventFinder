For the demonstration, you can use Postman to send requests to your API and capture screenshots or a screen recording of the responses.
 For example, to test the GET /api/v1/events/:date/:lat/:long/:page endpoint, you would send a GET request to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events/2024-03-24/40.7128/-74.0060/1 
and capture the response.
